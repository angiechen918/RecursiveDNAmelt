# RecursiveDNAmelt
This package implements the recursion model for the calculation of DNA melting probability profile reported in Tostesen, 2003. 

source code is under the "source" directory.

Documentation.ipynb contains an example of the usage of the package.

user_interface.py is an interactive program to run the program.

If a permission error happens, type:
$ chmod 755 user_interface.py 

To start the interactive program:
$ ./user_interface.py 

If biopython is not installed, run:
$ python -m pip install biopython

The results folder generated by running the user_interface.py file with the umelt example sequence,
"ACGACGTTGTAAAACGACAGAAGCATAGTATAGAAGAAAAAACAGCGCGCGCGGCGCCAACACATTCAACCTCTGCCACCATGGGGAACTGGGCTGTGAATGAGGGGCTCTCCATTTTTGTCATTGTAAGTACCAACAAGAGATAAGT", is included. The probability profile at 80 C and melting curve in the temperature range of 20C - 100C is generated and compared to the result from http://stitchprofiles.elixir.no/index.php.
